It is August and Cross is Coming [^1]. I'm getting excited because cyclocross is for whatever reason my favourite kind of bike racing.

I say "for whatever reason" because it doesn't seem intuitive to me that this would be my favourite. I'm not a big powerful rider pushing massive watts. I fall over a lot riding around on rough terrain. I don't like being cold and wet.

But yet, when I did my first cyclocross race I enjoyed it. I came back [last year to do more](2211121613-cyclocross-season.md). And even though I'm in the slowest category racing against kids and old guys, I really like it. I feel exhausted at the end of a race but I want to do it again.

It probably helps that we've had warm autumns since I started trying this out, so I haven't been doing the bitter shivering or sliding down icy off-cambers.

In the offseason I started compiling the Alberta Cyclocross Cup Race results into a spreadsheet to get a better sense of who the racers are. In 2022 I had a nemesis in the races. How did he do in the races I didn't enter? Getting all the data in one place seemed useful. So I built a Google Sheet. And then I learned about [crossresults.com](https://crossreults.com) and revamped my results to get them into a place for the wider North American scene. And it helps build up

[^1]: I wonder, did the "Cross is Coming" meme originate with Game of Thrones' HBO popularity? I assume so and am not checking.
