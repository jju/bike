## monk on a bike

I am not a monk. I am not withdrawn to natural remoteness. No swamps or rocky islands surround me, just refineries and politics I despise. I work in a digital world. Silicon and glass and user interfaces are the obstacles I help people navigate at work. I think I tend to use those tools well so it's a service to put those skills to work for the public.

But.

More and more I ~~hate~~ am disenchanted with this world. I understand that the world is objectively better because of the ways that information and communication technology have modified it. Sharing information is good, though not unreservedly so. And in the last few years as I've grown less and less enamoured with the internet I've been falling in love with bikes.

It's not a clean replacement, of course. I use the internet to think about bikes and get ideas for future bikes and shop for bike parts. The manufacture of these bikes is part of the whole overseas manufacturing supply chain that relies on standardized shipping containers and that same communication and fossil fuel burning network that I am trying to escape.

## building a bike

* chainreaction & jensonusa vs the local bike shop
* thoughts on components and their quality
* the act of wrenching

## riding a bike

* on the road - the dirt and the fumes and the traffic
* in the winter - toughguy styles I'm not to keen
* speed
* trails and concentration
* distance
* destinations

## being a cyclist

* environmentalism and the folly of all this
* the tribalism - jerseys and consumption 
* group rides or **solo**
