In 2023 I joined an actual club for biking, Edmonton's [Velocity Cycling Club](https://velocitycyclingclub.ca). We have a coach and club jerseys and it's all a bit more community-building than the lone-wolf cyclist thing I've been doing.

Now later in the season (it's August as I write this) I haven't taken huge advantage of being in the club. I've entered a couple of races (the [[230527-stiedaclassic2023|Stieda Classic]] and my first criterium, which was run by Velocity. But I've been on a couple of group rides and enjoyed them. The races give me a bit more reason to get out there, but I'm pretty well aware that I'm just not fit enough to actually race bikes and be competitive. Having someone wearing the same shirt as me out there though, it's weird but it does make a difference.

And the club gives me a chance to volunteer for specific events, like the crit where I marshalled in the afternoon after "racing" in the morning. I'm going to help with course setup for this season's [[230903-velocross2023|Velocity Cross race]] and maybe even do some causal CX midweek racing too.
