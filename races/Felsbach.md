| Muur de Felsbach | [[Felsbach]] | 6 | Mixed | [[Gasmea]] | [[Cobble]] |

> Though slightly less prestigious than its big brother, the Hegenberg Round [[Hegen]], this race is one of the few that regularly features grueling cobbled climbs and short, punchy climbs. A very tough classic, even for cobble experts.
