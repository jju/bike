> Hosted by the country's central bank, this classic around the Gasmean capital comes with a generous prize pool. Its slightly undulating route makes for good racing for sprinters and puncheurs alike.

## Notes

In 2022 Yusef Badawi had a good race after Jax blew up in the break. AJ had also done that in 2022's [[HVTour]] which was a bit ominous for the season.
