Bullwinkle is my cyclocross bike. It began as more of a commuter bike back in Nanaimo, taking advantage of the wider tires than a road bike (and more gears than my pre-existing track bike [[fujli]]). 

After moving to Edmonton and getting [[korg]] I moved the rack and Brooks saddle over to the heavier touring bike and Bullwinkle got to be my "fast" bike. 

Then after getting rid of [[fujli]] and getting [[wuming]] as a real go fast(ish) road bike, Bullwinkle really was allowed to go back to its roots in CX. Of course, the cyclocross season is only a couple of months so it's also the spring bike and the gravel bike.
