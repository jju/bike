# stationary

There is a gym in the basement of the county building my workplace is in. It has a stationary bike and some weights (and treadmills and rowing machines and stair climbers which I haven't tried). It is where I am starting my strength training regime.

But I am also spinning my legs on the stationary bike. During the times in the pandemic when things were closed down we saw stationary bikes out on sidewalks of gyms and the way we laughed at them for not riding outside on a real bike. Maybe we didn't laugh, but I feel like there were multiple pictures set up so that you would feel good about laughing at them.
