# Wildau Rhone Tour

| Name | Short Name | Prestige | Type | Nation | Terrain | Length |
|-----|------|------|-----|----|-----|-----|
| Wildau Rhone Tour | [[WilRho]] |  5 | Amateur | [[Hetvesia]] | [[Hilly]] | 3 Stages

> While this tour is pretty flat for Hetvesian standards it still features a mixed bag of terrain over three short stages. This can result in chaotic races which favours opportunists who can pack a punch or who are great all-rounders.
