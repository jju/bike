# the cyclist: tactics

There's a game I play called The Cyclist: Tactics. It's a newish game, kind of like a board game version of bike races. I like quantized representations of these kinds of continuous activities because they are easier to play with the reflexes of an old person like myself.

My first playthrough followed Andrew Jax on the Dubious Monk Racing team [tdm-racing](tdm-racing.md)

I've played different careers since then, starting up the [Gravel Ghost Collective](teams/GGC.md) team as my current playthrough.
