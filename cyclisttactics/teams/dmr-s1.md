# Season 1 - 2021

Andrew Jax is a Fruinian who came up through cyclocross as an amateur. Now a neo-pro who wasn't picked up by a team has attracted a sponsor (his rich uncle who wants to do something nice for the world and more especially his nephew) and they got David Perry to sign up.

Their kit this season was black with purple spatter.

## Roster

* Andrew Jax 3 Cobbles AJ
* Frank Albrecht 4 Climber FA
* David Perry 6 Rouleur DP
* Alessandro Mazza 3 Sprinter AM

Jax is not at all the leader of this small team, but is trying to learn the ropes in his first season.
