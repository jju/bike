# Season 4 - 2024

Changed the kit again this year for a more classic Celeste.

## Roster

* Otto Wolff 7 Rouleur [[Flat]]
* Javier Gonzalez 6 Rouleur [[Flat]]
* Marco Longo 6 Climber [[Mountain]]
* Pierluiggi Fabri 6 Cobble Puncher PF [[Mix]]
* Andrew Jax 6 Cobble Puncher AJ [[Mix]]
* Elias Vogel 5 Climber EV [[Mountain]]

Andrew Jax and Elias Vogel stayed with DMR for Season 4. Dropping Yusef Abbasi was a tough decision, but they needed to get better sooner with the extra money coming in.

## Races

### Lannen Grand Prix [[Lannen]]

5 Amateur [[Gasmea]] [[HillyMountain]] 4 Stages 

ML PF AJ EV*

* Stage 1 [[Hilly]] AJ 5 Red Jersey PF stayed in peloton otherwise all pretty good on GC.
* Stage 2 [[FlatHilly]] Lost a lot of GC time but handed Red Jersey to EV
* Stage 3 [[Mountain]] ML 2 EV 1 AJ climbed back into GC contention

EV5 AJ7 ML9 PF12

### Monte Pierona [[Pierona]]

6 Mixed [[Fruinia]] [[HillyMountain]]

JG15 ML* 7 AJ8 EV**5

The three climbers got in the top 10

We're chasing Lannen Sports Academy and Ultimate Sportswear in the amateur team standings.

### Federal Bank Open [[FedBO]]

6 Mixed [[Gasmea]] [[FlatHilly]]

OW JG PF AJ*

OW taking pulls, PF to cover the break, then JG and AJ come out Kraken and Lannen are the teams to watch closely. AJ played it out in almost textbook fashion, just getting pipped at the line to get second place instead of the win. The great thing is that we came out ahead of current season nemesis Lannen Sports Academy's Alikhan Shakhmetov. Ooo that guy. That also put us into 14th in the team rankings, the top amateur team!

### Dalluha Coast Race [[Coast]]

6 Mixed [[Dalluha]] [[Flat]] 5 Stages

OW* JG PF* EV

The plan for this stage race is for EV to grab as many of the climbs as possible. There are 12 points available and ideally he takes 9. JG runs as the leadout man for OW (who did a lot of work in the [[FedBO]] to get AJ on the podium).

* Stage 1 [[FlatHilly]] EV got enough of the 2 climbs for Red Jersey points to take that into stage 2. PF came in 8th on the stage tied for GC with the leader.
* Stage 2 [[Flat]] EV stayed in the pack while JG rode in the break for a long time. OW missed the decisive break and it looks like red jersey is all DMR will be acquiring in the overall.
* Stage 3 [[Flat]] 2 climbs for Red Jersey points -> EV's task
* Stage 4 [[Flat]]
* Stage 5 [[Flat]]

### Muur de Felsbach [[Felsbach]]

6 Mixed [[Gasmea]] [[Cobble]]

OW** JG PF** AJ*



### Southern Alps Tour [[SAlps]]

6 Mixed [[Hetvesia]] [[Mountain]] 6 Stages

JG** ML* AJ EV

This tour went amazingly for Team Dubious Monk. Stage wins and just out of first in GC filling up the podium. Javier Gonzalez and Marco Longo got on the podium and Elias Vogel snagged the Red Jersey. Even Andrew Jax (not a pure climber) made the top ten.

### Cloud Peak Circle [[Cloud]]

6 Mixed [[Hetvesia]] [[HillyMountain]] 6 Stages

Right on the heels of the Southern Alps, a slightly easier parcours for the climbers. DMR doesn't need as good of results here (they're currently the top amateur team this season), but they will be welcome.

OW ML** AJ EV*

* Stage 1 [[TT]] We don't have a time trial specialist, which should be on our radar if we are changing up the roster to compete in the grand tours.
* Stage 2 [[HillyMountain]] EV 2 on stage
* Stage 3 [[HillyMountain]] EV stage win! crushing red jersey
* Stage 4 [[Mountain]] Yellow Jersey cracked and bled time, but we couldn't gain as much as the stage winner. Doing fine in Red Jersey and also still holding green.
* Stage 5 [[HillyMountain]] The peloton decided to rest up in this race giving the escape group (with EV in it) a massive attack on GC. EV didn't get the stage win but moved into the yellow jersey (and held red) before the flattish final.
* Stage 6 [[FlatHilly]] AJ got the stage win and stayed in the top 10. The only loss on the day was EV losing the Green jersey but he wasn't really fighting for it anyway.

### Road to Novobeskov [[Novo]]

5 Amateur [[Archana]] [[FlatHilly]] 3 Stages

OW JG PF AJ*

This is AJ's third time racing in Archana, but the last ones were in his neopro season back in 2021. Now he has a stage win. OW got a stage podium and the red jersey, which isn't much in a race like this but should get the riders pumped for next month's Hammersbach.

### Daalbeck to Hammersbach [[Hammer]]

6 Mixed [[Gasmea]] [[Cobble]] 5 Stages 

OW* JG* PF* AJ**

Andrew Jax won the Hammersbach. He got three podiums on stages in the race without a win, but managed the overall.
