# Season 6 2026

## Roster

* Andrew Jax Cobble Expert
* Javier Gonzalez Rouleur
* Pierluigi Fabbri Cobble Puncher
* Yusef Abbasi TT Expert
* Elias Vogel Climber
* Marco Longo Climber

In the final analysis this was an amazing season of bike racing for Dubious Monk Racing team, and for Andrew Jax in particular. He came out of the season as the second place rider as far as prestige goes (behind Bruce Philips), and the team ranked 3rd in the world (despite not being invited to the Tour of Gasmea).

## Races

### Hegenberg Round [[Hegen]]

8 Pro [[Gasmea]] [[Cobble]]

AJ* JG PF YA

Jax opened up their first real pro season with a monument win! This got the team half the prestige necessary for the sponsors to be happy with the season.

Yusef Abbasi (back with the team after a year away) did a huge amount of work on the front of the peloton getting AJ and PF into position in the second half of the tough race. The escape never got far away because of YA and his unflagging work.

> Coming into this race and the whole season I was nervous. We'd made it up to the top echelons of cycling, almost (no Tour of Gasmea this season). And now I was taking on the leader role. I am not the climber that Marco and Elias are, and those big races are where we have done best as a team. Can I be the anchor through all this?

> Then it got worse after winning the Hegenberg. It was an under-attended race that our new sponsors weren't even that keen on us doing.


### Steinveg Classic [[Steinvej]]

8 Pro [[Gasmea]] [[Cobble]]

AJ** JG PF* YA

Sponsor Focus

This race garnered Andrew Jax his second Monument win! The rest of the team did much more poorly on this insanely rough long prcours, with Yusef Abbasi DNFing. But the season is now already a success in the eyes of the sponsors and DMR stands atop the pro rankings (as does AJ, who is taking the next month off to train up for the Giro).

> Oh my god, the pressure of this race. Especially after Hegenberg. They said that first one was a fluke and I believed it.

### Muur de Felsbach [[Felsbach]]

6 Mixed [[Gasmea]] [[Cobble]]

JG* ML PF** YA

Sponsor Focus

They were hoping to get PF a win here with ML on first pulling duty and YA as the final helper. In the end the team got Fabbri to the line okay, he just didn't quite have enough left to attack to the win going solo off the final cobbled climb. There were a few missed opportunities where a mental lapse meant a missed break, so the podium remains a pretty excellent result (even if it wasn't the dominating team display from 2024).

### Giro Fruinia [[Giro]]

9 Pro [[Fruinia]] [[Hilly]] 21 Stages

AJ* JG** EV YA*

The plan is to work for JG in this tour. Maybe some stage wins can happen? EV can go for Red Jersey.

Things didn't go well for most of the plans, but AJ came in 3rd on GC (and got a couple of stage wins).

1. [[FlatHilly]] 226 Flat Finish Stayed with the peloton, on the same time as the leaders without going for any of the big sprints. We kept JG up near the front too, so that was mission accomplished for day 1. EV and YA are .74 down.
2. [[HillyMountain]] 435 Hilltop Finish AJ1(1)R JG2(2) EV17 YA43
3. [[HillyMountain]] 269 Flat Finish AJ1R JG4 EV15 YA
4. [[FlatHilly]] 312 Flat Finish JG2 AJ3R EV18 YA
5. [[FlatHilly]] 203 Flat Finish 

> stage 1: This is a big one. Three weeks of racing. I don't know if I can handle it. I'm losing my chops on the climbs and I don't think I can help the way I need to to be a good teammate. How do we save ourselves for this amount of time? I've won a couple of monuments now and people are expecting something big from me, but I don't know what I can possibly do to live up to that.
> stage 2: If we can get EV the red jersey for at least a day that's going to be awesome. This is when I'm going to have to work hard for him. YA and JG are going to need to catch up later after the halfway point. After the second Red Jersey point I grabbed too many and started working too hard, finding myself way out in front. I heard that YA and the peloton were a long way back and I made a mistake. Then the bunch with EV dropped me as I tried to get back in with them but I caught up on the descent. We made a big push for the minor mountain points and I know EV was starting to really feel it. But he bounces back okay. After the fourth KoM opportunity Vogel was done, and I sucked onto the escape group just to keep our chances alive up there, until JG could catch on. Then I kept on hanging on to that Kraken Big Data asshole who'd been up there the entire time and in the end I got around him and won a Giro stage. Holy shit. Also grabbed the red jersey points, but between me and EV that's okay I think.
> Stage 3: This is a shorter stage and I think we need to flood the front, with EV collecting Red Jersey points. It sort of worked, but JG dropped from 2nd to 4th on GC. I missed the final break through sticking with the slightly conservative plan.
> Stage 4: We lost the leader jersey but hung onto red. I missed the break on the climb trying to hang on with JG. This defensive shit is hard especially so early. We're not even a quarter way through this thing and I'm feeling it.
> Stage 5: Today there isn't much risk on the red jersey but we'll send EV out on the climb to grab some more if he can. The rest of it is sticking on the wheels of Yellow Weber Green Anisimov and Caruso. If any of them are in the break I'm going to have to go with it and let JG rest up. He just doesn't have the power to blast up the mountain if needed. Ideally everything stays together calmly until the climb in the middle, then EV and I can zip up that grab some points and stick with the peloton the rest of the way. I really want an unthreatening break to go off for the stage win, but how likely is tha? I don't know.



### Sky Race [[SkyRace]]

8 Pro [[Hetvesia]] [[Mountain]]

ML* EV PF YA

Marco Longo hit the top 5 in this race for climbers.

### Vista Hetvesia [[Vista]]

8 Pro [[Hetvesia]] [[Mountain]] 14 Stages

AJ ML** EV* YA

This tour showed that AJ shouldn't be in big tours. He's a classics rider only. He DNF

### Mara Lake Circuit [[Mara]]

7 Pro [[Archana]] [[FlatHilly]]

AJ JG PF YA*

Sponsor Focus

This race looks underattended this year and we're targeting it for YA. In the end Abbasi didn't have the legs so Jax snagged another Classics win.

### Archana Tour [[ArchTour]]

8 Pro [[Archana]] [[Hilly]] 14 Stages

AJ JG* EV* YA**

Sponsor Focus. It didn't start out too well. AJ is targetting stage wins, YA and JG trying to keep close in GC, while EV goes for the Red jersey.

* Halfway through and AJ got a stage win and is second (behind EV) for the Red Jersey. YA still has a shot at cracking the top ten overall.
* By the end of the tour EV collected the Red Jersey, AJ got a stage win and a top 5 finish. YA and JG were out of the picture.

### Meranio Trophy [[Meranio]]

7 Pro [[Fruinia]] [[HillyMountain]] Monument

AJ ML* EV** PF*

Sponsor Focus

The plan in this one is basically to burn PF out early keeping the break from going too soon. Ideally EV gets a shot at the win, but AJ is ever the opportunist.

* AJ made the final break and sprinted from the 8-guy break.
