# Season 1 - 2021



Their kit this season was gray with a black star.

## Roster

* Soto Ichiro Tech Cobbles 2
* Vladislav Pavlov Novice 1
* Denis Tarasov TT 2
* Pavel Gusev Rouleur 2

These amateurs are not looking at winning any tours, at least not yet. Targeting one-day races is more the plan.
## Races

### TTT Challenge [TTTC](../races/TTTC.md)

6 Mixed [Archana](../nations/Archana.md) [Flat](../racetypes/Flat.md) [TT](../racetypes/TT.md)

8th place as a team.

### Monte Pierona [Pierona](../races/Pierona.md)

6 Mixed [[Fruinia]] [[HillyMountain]]

The team's first international jaunt had three big climbs with somewhat techy descents before a flat run in to the end. The GGC plan was to ride this for Tarasov, and it mostly worked. He just didn't quite have enough punch at the end to outsprint anyone uphill. Soto hung back as a backup if the plan fell apart in the end, and managed to come in 6th.

### Rising Sun Rush [RSRush](../races/RSRush.md)

6 Amateur [Dalluha](../nations/Dalluha.md) [Flat](../racetypes/Flat.md)

Vladislav Pavlov went into the early break, not really expecting it to stick on this fast flat course. Gusev tried to control the peloton to keep Pavlov away and did his job super well getting Tarasov and Soto into 3rd and 4th while Pavlov claimed the team's first win.

### Weisshorn Challenge [Weiss](../races/Weiss.md)

5 Amateur [Hetvesia](../nations/Hetvesia.md) [Mountain](../racetypes/Mountain.md)

Without a pure climber on the team the GGC wasn't expecting much. But Vladislav Pavlov surprised everyone by coming in 2nd.

### Round Highport

6 Amateur [Gasmea](../nations/Gasmea.md) [Cobble](../racetypes/Cobble.md)

This is the kind of race Soto Ichiro is hoping to claim as his own in the future. There was only one cobbled section which wasn't enough to shred the peloton or the other experts so he had to settle for 6th, but still not too shabby.

### Chrono Ridge [Chrono](../races/Chrono.md)

6 Mixed [Hetvesia](Hetvesia.md) [Mountain](Mountain.md)Â [TT](TT.md)

This race was mostly just to fill a slot in the calendar for the Gravel Collective. Getting both Tarasov and Pavlov into the top 10 was a nice surprise.
