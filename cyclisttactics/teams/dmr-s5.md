## Races

### Hegenberg Round [[Hegen]]

8 Pro [[Gasmea]] [[Cobble]]

AJ* JG PF YA

Jax opened up their first real pro season with a monument win! This got the team half the prestige necessary for the sponsors to be happy with the season.

Yusef Abbasi (back with the team after a year away) did a huge amount of work on the front of the peloton getting AJ and PF into position in the second half of the tough race. The escape never got far away because of YA and his unflagging work.

> Coming into this race and the whole season I was nervous. We'd made it up to the top echelons of cycling, almost (no Tour of Gasmea this season). And now I was taking on the leader role. I am not the climber that Marco and Elias are, and those big races are where we have done best as a team. Can I be the anchor through all this?

> Then it got worse after winning the Hegenberg. It was an under-attended race that our new sponsors weren't even that keen on us doing.


### Steinveg Classic [[Steinvej]]

8 Pro [[Gasmea]] [[Cobble]]

AJ** JG PF* YA

Sponsor Focus

This race garnered Andrew Jax his second Monument win! The rest of the team did much more poorly on this insanely rough long prcours, with Yusef Abbasi DNFing. But the season is now already a success in the eyes of the sponsors and DMR stands atop the pro rankings (as does AJ, who is taking the next month off to train up for the Giro).
