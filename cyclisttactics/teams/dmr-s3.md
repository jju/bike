# Season 3 - 2023

The second season for Dubious Monk Racing saw the team falter a bit, so they brought in some new blood to get things on track. This year brought more of a focus on flatter races.

## Roster

* Idrees Kashif 6 Downhill IK [[Mountain]]
* Andrew Jax 5 Cobble Puncher AJ [[Mountain]]
* Alexander Cook 5 Barodeur AC [[Flat]]
* Elias Vogel 4 Climber EV [[Mountain]]
* Yusef Badawi 2 Rouleur YB [[Flat]]
* Yusef Abbasi TT 2 TT YA [[Flat]]

Andrew Jax and Yusef Badawi are the only ones who stayed with DMR into Season 3. The hopes are that Elias Vogel and Yusef Abbasi can eventually make this team a grand tour contender.

## Wildau Rhone Tour [[WilRho]]

We did very well in this race, EV got the Red Jersey with AJ and YA 2nd and 3rd.


## Weisshorn Challenge [[Weiss]]

5 Amateur [[Hetvesia]] [[Mountain]] 

EV1 YA2 AJ3 IK5

This mountain classic was severely underattended. When the break went DMR flooded it and kept it going to the end to crush it as a team. EV enjoyed his first win and YA's first podium was also sweet.

## Cloud Peak Circle [[Cloud]]

6 Mixed [[Hetvesia]] [[HillyMountain]] 6 Stages

After a couple of amateur races to boost the palmares collection (and Jax's uncle's spirits) we head back into stiffer competition.

AJ** IK EV** YA

* Stage 1 Prologue [[Hilly]] EV8 IK13 AJ18 YA23
* Stage 2 [[HillyMountain]] AJ4(5GC) Red and Green Jersey IK9(8GC) EV12(12GC) YA23(25GC)
* Stage 3 [[HillyMountain]] EV3 AJ3 YA29 IK30

* Stage 5 [[Mountain]] EV2(GC6) AJ8(GC5 Red Jersey) IK21(GC13) YA22(GC32)
* Stage 6 [[Hilly]] EV2 (GC6) AJ5(GC5 Red Jersey)

AJ and EV came in on major fitness peaks and got wht they wanted a top5 overall and Red Jersey for AJ and two stage podiums for EV

## Naubad Classic

5 Amateur [[Hetvesia]] [[HillyMountain]]

IK AC YA YB

Jax didn't come back to the race he won in 2022. Only four teams entered, but DMR was at a talent deficit to get IK a win.

They spent everything they had to do it but the team got Idrees his first win for DMR.

## Round Highport [[Highport]]

6 Amateur [[Gasmea]] [[Cobble]]

AC AJ YB YA

We got shelled. AJ was in the break all day and ran out of steam at the end. We need to learn to pace ourselves better in these long flat races.

## Rolling Hills Race [[RHills]]

5 Amateur [[Fruinia]] [[FlatHilly]]

Last race of the season and though the sponsor is happy with us, they'd like us to do well here.

IK AJ EV YB

YB got a podium!
