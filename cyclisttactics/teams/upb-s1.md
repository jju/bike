# Season 1 - 2021

UPB only had 5 riders for their inaugural season.

Their kit this season was gray with a lighter star to emulate the titanium of their sponsors' bikes.

## Roster

* Wu Ming - TT
* Vladislav Pavlov - Novice
* Antonio Rossi - Downhill
* Arash Bukhari - Rouleur
* Nasim Farzan - Sprinter

Antonio Rossi is the old veteran (he's 23) of the team brought in to try and get some results while the younguns get good. They don't have a true climber on the roster yet but Pavlov might be able to develop in that direction. Rossi and Bukhari are the most likely to be dropped in 2022 if they can find a replacement with good upside for future development.

Wu Ming sat this one out in an effort to rest his legs and prepare for the rest of the season. Also this is where he began composing his writing about the races and his new career.

* Stage 1: VP was pulling to get NF sprinter points but they were practically worthless as whoever won the stage would get even more and claim the green jersey. So AR just up and won the stage. Wu=amazed
* Stage 2: The gruelling climb was way too much, but Rossi kept up with Simon Schuster and didn't relinquish Yellow. AB clawed up into 3rd on GC as well, while VP and NF did their best to conserve energy at the back. It didn't help VP that much but NF now has the chance to keep Simon Schuster away from sprint points in stage four to give the team at least one fancy jersey at the end of the race.
* Stage 3: VP has not fallen off the back of the peloton yet. The green jersey was secured for Rossi and the closest challengers on GC shed a bunch of time. Now the final stage is a mountain climber's paradise. Rossi isn't ging to defend Red at the cost of GC ambitions, and has 3 turns to play with after the big descent and flats so defensive riding should carry the day there.
* Stage 4: Defense did win the day, but not without some help from our opponents. Two riders Kohler and were close enough to Rossi on GC to make a move, but they were pulling the peloton instead. By the end of the stage, even with the big climbs, Rossi just had to stick around the front, which worked out perfectly for him. He also kept the red and green jerseys.

### Hills of Wazduk [[Wazduk]]

5 Amateur [[Archana]] [[Hilly]]

AB* Wu NF VP*

Going in without Rossi, who's been celebrating his Vitessa win, we're trying to get Pavlov a top 10. None of our riders are at all favoured but we'll do our best.

AB got second place, just being outsprinted at the line by David Molina. Pavlov and Wu just made the top 10 as well. All in all, a successful race.

### Wildau Rhone Tour [[WilRho]]

5 Amateur [[Hetvesia]] [[Hilly]] 3 Stages

AR AB** Wu NF

* AB came in second on the first stage with a full team performance.
* NF claimed sprint points throughout this stage to grab the green jersey and Wu held red.
* In the final analysis, AB got 2nd on GC on the same time as the winner. Wu got 2nd in the Red Jersey on the same points as the winner
