# Season 1 - 2021

Andrew Jax is a Fruinian who came up through cyclocross as an amateur. Now a neo-pro who wasn't picked up by a team has attracted a sponsor (his rich uncle who wants to do something nice for the world and more especially his nephew) and they got David Perry to sign up.

Their kit this season was black with purple spatter.

## Roster

* Andrew Jax 3 Cobbles AJ
* Frank Albrecht 4 Climber FA
* David Perry 6 Rouleur DP
* Alessandro Mazza 3 Sprinter AM

Jax is not at all the leader of this small team, but is trying to learn the ropes in his first season.

## Races

### Hills and Valley Tour [[HVTour]]

5 Amateur [[Fruinia]] [[Hilly]] 3 Stages

AJ04 FA07 DP09 AM13

Jax stuck it out and got 4th in GC in his first real stage race.

### TTT Challenge [[TTTC]]

6 Mixed [[Archana]] [[Flat]][[TT]]

AM20 DP21 AJ22

Team Dubious Monk Racing probably shouldn't have tried this event, but most other races were full up.

### Weisshorn Challenge [[Weiss]]

5 Amateur [[Hetvesia]] [[Mountain]]

FA06 AJ10 DP13

Jax got another top 10 in support of Albrecht who just missed the top 5. Jax's uncle was very pleased.

### Hills of Wazduk [[Wazduk]]

5 Amateur [[Archana]] [[Hilly]]

DP06 AJ09 AM16

Two top-10s again, but Mazza is growing disappointed in his role with the team.

### Rising Sun Rush [[RSRush]]

6 Amateur [[Dalluha]] [[Flat]]

DP06 AJ16 FA27

Perry was out of the top-5 and it made for a generally poor race. Mazza was furious that Allbrecht had been chosen to race the flats.

### Naubad Classic [[Naubad]]

5 Amateur [[Hetvesia]] [[HillyMountain]]

FA02 DP06 AJ11 AM18

Bringing in the full team for once, got Albrecht a podium and made Jax's uncle quite pleased.

### Ellisbury Cup [[Ellis]]

6 Amateur [[Gasmea]] [[Flat]]

DP02 AJ05 AM10 

Mazza ended up being a non-factor while Perry got a podium and Jax nabbed a top-5 finish.

### Rolling Hills Race [[RHills]]

5 Amateur [[Fruinia]] [[FlatHilly]]

AM04 DP05 FA07 AJ12

Mazza finally got his due, with Perry leading out his final sprint. Jax worked hard and was fine finishing out of the top-10.


# Season 2 - 2022

The first season of Team Dubious Monk was a great success and Jax's uncle gave them more money to play with now that they were ranked 29th instead of 44th.

## Roster

* Frank Albrecht 4 Climber FA
* Andrew Jax 4 Cobbles AJ
* Ezio Farina 4 TT EF
* Alessandro Mazza 3 Sprinter AM
* Samir Bilal 3 Sprinter SB
* Yusef Badawi 1 Novice YB

Scouting in 2021 found Samir Bilal and Yusef Badawi in Dalluha. Mazza was again pissed that another sprinter was being added to the mix. David Perry was also released in favour of Ezio Farina, a Time Trial expert. The team is now larger so a full squad can head to each of the races, unlike in 2021. The flip side is that there is no clear leader the way they had with David Perry.

They changed kit for this season to an orange with blue star jersey.

## Races

### Hills and Valley Tour [[HVTour]]

5 Amateur [[Fruinia]] [[Hilly]] 3 Stages
AJ* AM SB YB* 

* Stage 1 In the flat first stage Andrew Jax got 4th place, which was good, but came at the expense of his recovery efforts. 
* Stage 2 Stay ahead of Billy King Catch Daniele Bruno and Dmitry Sorokin - Jax got 4th on the stage moved into 2nd on GC behind Daniele Bruno. Really worried about defending that in the third stage with the climbing. 
* Stage 3 AJ doesn't have a good enough Recovery ability and blew up, dropping to 6 on GC after trying to go with the break. A top ten is good but defending a position in the mountains didn’t work without a team that could really help.

### Monte Pierona [[Pierona]]

6 Mixed [[Fruinia]] [[HillyMountain]]

FA* EF AM* SB 

FA 12th Didn't have enough help plan EF working for FA in break SB working for AM in bunch - so disappointing, everything blew up we did not have the skills to compete in this mountainy race.

### Federal Bank Open [[FedBO]]

6 Mixed [[Gasmea]] [[FlatHilly]]

AJ AM** SB* YB 

AJ was back from a rest race and blew up again coming in 20th overall. The break went so far but then he was swallowed. YB worked hard and levelled up to rouleur. Mazza's peak was totally wasted and he's upset about the season.

### Muur de Felsbach [[Felsbach]]

6 Mixed [[Gasmea]] [[Cobble]]

FA AJ SB** YB 

Jax stayed in peloton when early break went but joined the late one with FA support, and claimed 5th on the day. This doesn't quite redeem the season yet, but made a good start. He levelled up to cobble puncher and took attack.

### Vitessa Spring Open [[Vitessa]]

6 Amateur [[Fruinia]] [[Mountain]] 4 Stages

FA* AJ AM YB 

The team had low expectations for this short tour. The plan was to race conservatively for Albrecht, with Jax poised to try taking over if he falters. YB is the first option for pulling. If the flat section is first YB will be dragging AM to the line.

* Oof stage one was a beast. FA lost a lot of time to the leaders. 
* Stage 2 crawled back to 8 & 9 on GC 
* stage 3 flat hilly FA had a terrible ride but hung onto the peloton to stay with Jax in 8/9 
* stage 4 mtn finish AJ and FA came in 8&9 to claim 7&8 overall

### Southern Alps Tour [[SAlps]]

6 Mixed [[Hetvesia]] [[Mountain]] 6 Stages

FA** AJ EF* AM

The Time Trial is Farina's time to shine. He'll ride in the peloton until then and afterwards be a helper. Mazza gets the same deal while Jax is lead on the cobbles then going with Albrecht for the big climbs.

Such an incredibly bad idea to do this tour.

* Stage 1 [[Mountain]] (flat finish) spent the entirety in the peloton. FA and AJ got 12 & 13 not entirely exhausted Billy King is AJ's nemesis
* Stage 2 [[Mountain]] (M finish) ugh. held onto GC status but that was ugly
* Stage 3 [[Cobble]] ([[HillyMountain]]) FA resting this stage, AM the helper for AJ who is gassed AJ crept up to 11th on GC
* Stage 4 [[TT]] AJ lost time to drop to 12 on GC
* Stage 6 [[HillyMountain]] AJ and AM are out of energy completely AJ will be falling from 12, which probably isn't so bad if they can get FA up into the top10. FA got 9th on the stage, and AJ got 12th, getting them into 9 and 10 overall
* Stage 5 [[Mountain]] ADS and HAD battling for 1 on GC (.02 between them) Need to stay ahead of Jonathan Harris and Vadim Filippov. FA 11 and AJ 14 on stage
* Overall: FA9 AJ11 EF 25 AM34

### Chrono Ridge [[Chrono]]

6 Mixed [[Hetvesia]] [[Mountain]] [[TT]]

AJ EF** AM* SB

Mazza is pissed that this is one of his big moments in the season. If he's coming back next season the team needs to treat him much differently.

Weird tiny race 22 node length. EF got 10th place.

### Naubad Classic [[Naubad]]

5 Amateur [[Hetvesia]] [[HillyMountain]]

FA AJ* SB*? YB*

FA came in second last year and was hoping to improve on that. In the end, FA came in 8, but AJ got his first ever win! From a bunch sprint out of a group of 7 that escaped right at the beginning. That pulled the season out of the midden heap and made for a great success heading into the Lannen Grand Prix.

### Lannen Grand Prix [[Lannen]]

5 Amateur [[Gasmea]] [[HillyMountain]] 4 Stages 

FA AJ** EF YB**

* Stage 1 [[Hilly]] AJ in 9th place but close to leader
* Stage 2 [[FlatHilly]] AJ & FA 3/4 on the stage, AJ Green Jersey and 2nd on GC
* Stage 3 [[Mountain]] AJ kept Green, slipped to 4th on GC, FA & YB are 11 & 12
* Stage 4 [[HillyMountain]] AJ 4th on stage, kept Green, 4th overall, FA7, YB9 overall

This was a good result for the team. Yusef got 9th place in the end.

# Season 3 - 2023

The second season for Dubious Monk Racing saw the team falter a bit, so they brought in some new blood to get things on track. This year brought more of a focus on flatter races.

## Roster

* Idrees Kashif 6 Downhill IK [[Mountain]]
* Andrew Jax 5 Cobble Puncher AJ [[Mountain]]
* Alexander Cook 5 Barodeur AC [[Flat]]
* Elias Vogel 4 Climber EV [[Mountain]]
* Yusef Badawi 2 Rouleur YB [[Flat]]
* Yusef Abbasi TT 2 TT YA [[Flat]]

Andrew Jax and Yusef Badawi are the only ones who stayed with DMR into Season 3. The hopes are that Elias Vogel and Yusef Abbasi can eventually make this team a grand tour contender.

## Races

### Hills and Valley Tour [[HVTour]] 

5 Amateur  [[Fruinia]] [[Hilly]] 3 Stages

IK AJ EV YB

* Stage 1 [[Hilly]] AJ3 and Red Jersey EV9 IK11
* Stage 2 [[Flat]] AJ7, dropped to 4th on GC
* Stage 3 [[Mountain]] EV got 3rd on the stage and a top ten finish, AJ dropped to 5th on GC, second for Red Jersey.

### Basara Sprints [[Sprints]]

6 Amateur [[Dalluha]] [[Flat]] 4 Stages 

No great results here. AC got a top ten overall.

### Dalluha Coast Race [[Coast]]

6 Mixed [[Dalluha]] [[Flat]] 5 Stages

AJ19 EV28 YB15 AC12

* Stage 1 out of the top ten
* Stage 2 nothing good happening
* Stage 3 AJ/EV going for the Red Jersey because everyone is down from the GC
* Stage 4
* Stage 5

AJ Red Jersey (EV 3rd for Red)

## Wildau Rhone Tour [[WilRho]]

5 Amateur [[Hetvesia]] [[Hilly]] 3 Stages

EV2 AJ3 YA14 IK19

We did very well in this race, EV got the Red Jersey with AJ and YA 2nd and 3rd.


## Weisshorn Challenge [[Weiss]]

5 Amateur [[Hetvesia]] [[Mountain]] 

EV1 YA2 AJ3 IK5

This mountain classic was severely underattended. When the break went DMR flooded it and kept it going to the end to crush it as a team. EV enjoyed his first win and YA's first podium was also sweet.

## Cloud Peak Circle [[Cloud]]

6 Mixed [[Hetvesia]] [[HillyMountain]] 6 Stages

After a couple of amateur races to boost the palmares collection (and Jax's uncle's spirits) we head back into stiffer competition.

AJ** IK EV** YA

* Stage 1 Prologue [[Hilly]] EV8 IK13 AJ18 YA23
* Stage 2 [[HillyMountain]] AJ4(5GC) Red and Green Jersey IK9(8GC) EV12(12GC) YA23(25GC)
* Stage 3 [[HillyMountain]] EV3 AJ3 YA29 IK30
* Stage 4 [[FlatHilly]] AJ11 EV12 IK16 YA27
* Stage 5 [[Mountain]] EV2(GC6) AJ8(GC5 Red Jersey) IK21(GC13) YA22(GC32)
* Stage 6 [[Hilly]] EV2 (GC6) AJ5(GC5 Red Jersey)

AJ and EV came in on major fitness peaks and got wht they wanted a top5 overall and Red Jersey for AJ and two stage podiums for EV

## Naubad Classic

5 Amateur [[Hetvesia]] [[HillyMountain]]

IK AC YA YB

Jax didn't come back to the race he won in 2022. Only four teams entered, but DMR was at a talent deficit to get IK a win.

They spent everything they had to do it but the team got Idrees his first win for DMR.

## Round Highport [[Highport]]

6 Amateur [[Gasmea]] [[Cobble]]

AC AJ YB YA

We got shelled. AJ was in the break all day and ran out of steam at the end. We need to learn to pace ourselves better in these long flat races.

## Rolling Hills Race [[RHills]]

5 Amateur [[Fruinia]] [[FlatHilly]]

Last race of the season and though the sponsor is happy with us, they'd like us to do well here.

IK AJ EV YB

YB got a podium!


# Season 4 - 2024

Changed the kit again this year for a more classic Celeste.

## Roster

* Otto Wolff 7 Rouleur [[Flat]]
* Javier Gonzalez 6 Rouleur [[Flat]]
* Marco Longo 6 Climber [[Mountain]]
* Pierluiggi Fabri 6 Cobble Puncher PF [[Mix]]
* Andrew Jax 6 Cobble Puncher AJ [[Mix]]
* Elias Vogel 5 Climber EV [[Mountain]]

Andrew Jax and Elias Vogel stayed with DMR for Season 4. Dropping Yusef Abbasi was a tough decision, but they needed to get better sooner with the extra money coming in.

## Races

### Lannen Grand Prix [[Lannen]]

5 Amateur [[Gasmea]] [[HillyMountain]] 4 Stages 

ML PF AJ EV*

* Stage 1 [[Hilly]] AJ 5 Red Jersey PF stayed in peloton otherwise all pretty good on GC.
* Stage 2 [[FlatHilly]] Lost a lot of GC time but handed Red Jersey to EV
* Stage 3 [[Mountain]] ML 2 EV 1 AJ climbed back into GC contention
* Stage 4 [[HillyMountain]] EV 5 AJ7 & Red Jersey

EV5 AJ7 ML9 PF12

### Monte Pierona [[Pierona]]

6 Mixed [[Fruinia]] [[HillyMountain]]

JG15 ML* 7 AJ8 EV**5

The three climbers got in the top 10

We're chasing Lannen Sports Academy and Ultimate Sportswear in the amateur team standings.

### Federal Bank Open [[FedBO]]

6 Mixed [[Gasmea]] [[FlatHilly]]

OW JG PF AJ*

OW taking pulls, PF to cover the break, then JG and AJ come out Kraken and Lannen are the teams to watch closely. AJ played it out in almost textbook fashion, just getting pipped at the line to get second place instead of the win. The great thing is that we came out ahead of current season nemesis Lannen Sports Academy's Alikhan Shakhmetov. Ooo that guy. That also put us into 14th in the team rankings, the top amateur team!

### Dalluha Coast Race [[Coast]]

6 Mixed [[Dalluha]] [[Flat]] 5 Stages

OW* JG PF* EV

The plan for this stage race is for EV to grab as many of the climbs as possible. There are 12 points available and ideally he takes 9. JG runs as the leadout man for OW (who did a lot of work in the [[FedBO]] to get AJ on the podium).

* Stage 1 [[FlatHilly]] EV got enough of the 2 climbs for Red Jersey points to take that into stage 2. PF came in 8th on the stage tied for GC with the leader.
* Stage 2 [[Flat]] EV stayed in the pack while JG rode in the break for a long time. OW missed the decisive break and it looks like red jersey is all DMR will be acquiring in the overall.
* Stage 3 [[Flat]] 2 climbs for Red Jersey points -> EV's task
* Stage 4 [[Flat]]
* Stage 5 [[Flat]]

### Muur de Felsbach [[Felsbach]]

6 Mixed [[Gasmea]] [[Cobble]]

OW** JG PF** AJ*



### Southern Alps Tour [[SAlps]]

6 Mixed [[Hetvesia]] [[Mountain]] 6 Stages

JG** ML* AJ EV

This tour went amazingly for Team Dubious Monk. Stage wins and just out of first in GC filling up the podium. Javier Gonzalez and Marco Longo got on the podium and Elias Vogel snagged the Red Jersey. Even Andrew Jax (not a pure climber) made the top ten.

### Cloud Peak Circle [[Cloud]]

6 Mixed [[Hetvesia]] [[HillyMountain]] 6 Stages

Right on the heels of the Southern Alps, a slightly easier parcours for the climbers. DMR doesn't need as good of results here (they're currently the top amateur team this season), but they will be welcome.

OW ML** AJ EV*

* Stage 1 [[TT]] We don't have a time trial specialist, which should be on our radar if we are changing up the roster to compete in the grand tours.
* Stage 2 [[HillyMountain]] EV 2 on stage
* Stage 3 [[HillyMountain]] EV stage win! crushing red jersey
* Stage 4 [[Mountain]] Yellow Jersey cracked and bled time, but we couldn't gain as much as the stage winner. Doing fine in Red Jersey and also still holding green.
* Stage 5 [[HillyMountain]] The peloton decided to rest up in this race giving the escape group (with EV in it) a massive attack on GC. EV didn't get the stage win but moved into the yellow jersey (and held red) before the flattish final.
* Stage 6 [[FlatHilly]] AJ got the stage win and stayed in the top 10. The only loss on the day was EV losing the Green jersey but he wasn't really fighting for it anyway.

EV1&Red AJ9 ML10 OW13

### Road to Novobeskov [[Novo]]

5 Amateur [[Archana]] [[FlatHilly]] 3 Stages

OW JG PF AJ*

This is AJ's third time racing in Archana, but the last ones were in his neopro season back in 2021. Now he has a stage win. OW got a stage podium and the red jersey, which isn't much in a race like this but should get the riders pumped for next month's Hammersbach.

### Daalbeck to Hammersbach [[Hammer]]

6 Mixed [[Gasmea]] [[Cobble]] 5 Stages 

OW* JG* PF* AJ**

Andrew Jax won the Hammersbach. He got three podiums on stages in the race without a win, but managed the overall.

### Hegenberg Round [[Hegen]]

8 Pro [[Gasmea]] [[Cobble]]

AJ* JG PF YA

Jax opened up their first real pro season with a monument win! This got the team half the prestige necessary for the sponsors to be happy with the season.

Yusef Abbasi (back with the team after a year away) did a huge amount of work on the front of the peloton getting AJ and PF into position in the second half of the tough race. The escape never got far away because of YA and his unflagging work.
