# Season 1 - 2021

Andrew Jax is a Fruinian who came up through cyclocross as an amateur. Now a neo-pro who wasn't picked up by a team has attracted a sponsor (his rich uncle who wants to do something nice for the world and more especially his nephew) and they got David Perry to sign up.

## Roster

* Andrew Jax 3 Cobbles AJ
* Frank Albrecht 4 Climber FA
* David Perry 6 Rouleur DP
* Alessandro Mazza 3 Sprinter AM

Jax is not at all the leader of this small team, but is trying to learn the ropes in his first season.

## Races

### Hills and Valley Tour (Amateur) 3 Stages 1F-2C 
* AJ04 FA07 DP09 AM13

Jax stuck it out and got 4th in GC in his first real stage race.

### TTT Challenge (Mixed) TTT
* AM20 DP21 AJ22

Team Dubious Monk Racing probably shouldn't have tried this event, but most other races were full up.

### Weisshorn Challenge (Amateur) M
* FA06 AJ10 DP13

Jax got another top 10 in support of Albrecht who just missed the top 5. Jax's uncle was very pleased.

### Hills of Wazduk (Amateur) H
* DP06 AJ09 AM16

Two top-10s again, but Mazza is growing disappointed in his role with the team.

### Rising Sun Rush (Amateur) F
* DP06 AJ16 FA27

Perry was out of the top-5 and it made for a generally poor race. Mazza was furious that Allbrecht had been chosen to race the flats.

### Naubad Classic (Amateur) C
* FA02 DP06 AJ11 AM18

Bringing in the full team for once, got Albrecht a podium and made Jax's uncle quite pleased.

### Ellisbury Cup (Amateur) F
* DP02 AJ05 AM10 

Mazza ended up being a non-factor while Perry got a podium and Jax nabbed a top-5 finish.

### Rolling Hills Race (Amateur) H
* AM04 DP05 FA07 AJ12

Mazza finally got his due, with Perry leading out his final sprint. Jax worked hard and was fine finishing out of the top-10.


# Season 2 - 2022

The first season of Team Dubious Monk was a great success and Jax's uncle gave them more money to play with now that they were ranked 29th instead of 44th.

## Roster

* Frank Albrecht 4 Climber FA
* Andrew Jax 4 Cobbles AJ
* Ezio Farina 4 TT EF
* Alessandro Mazza 3 Sprinter AM
* Samir Bilal 3 Sprinter SB
* Yusef Badawi 1 Novice YB

Scouting in 2021 found Samir Bilal and Yusef Badawi in Dalluha. Mazza was again pissed that another sprinter was being added to the mix. David Perry was also released in favour of Ezio Farina, a Time Trial expert. The team is now larger so a full squad can head to each of the races, unlike in 2021. The flip side is that there is no clear leader the way they had with David Perry.

## Races

### Hills and Valley Tour (Amateur) 3 Stage 1F-2C
 AJ* AM SB YB* 
* Stage 1 In the flat first stage Andrew Jax got 4th place, which was good, but came at the expense of his recovery efforts. 
* Stage 2 Stay ahead of Billy King Catch Daniele Bruno and Dmitry Sorokin - Jax got 4th on the stage moved into 2nd on GC behind Daniele Bruno. Really worried about defending that in the third stage with the climbing. 
* Stage 3 AJ doesn't have a good enough Recovery ability and blew up, dropping to 6 on GC after trying to go with the break. A top ten is good but defending a position in the mountains didn’t work without a team that could really help.

### Monte Pierona (Mixed) H
FA* EF AM* SB 

FA 12th Didn't have enough help plan EF working for FA in break SB working for AM in bunch - so disappointing, everything blew up we did not have the skills to compete in this mountainy race.

### Federal Bank Open (Mixed) F
AJ AM** SB* YB 

AJ was back from a rest race and blew up again coming in 20th overall. The break went so far but then he was swallowed. YB worked hard and levelled up to rouleur. Mazza's peak was totally wasted and he's upset about the season.

### Muur de Felsbach (Mixed) C
FA AJ SB** YB 

Jax stayed in peloton when early break went but joined the late one with FA support, and claimed 5th on the day. This doesn't quite redeem the season yet, but made a good start. He levelled up to cobble puncher and took attack.

### Vitessa Spring Open (Amateur) 4 Stages 1F-1H-2M
FA* AJ AM YB 

The team has low expectations for this short tour. The plan is to race conservatively for Albrecht, with Jax poised to try taking over if he falters. YB is the first option for pulling. If the flat section is first YB will be dragging AM to the line.

* Oof stage one was a beast. FA lost a lot of time to the leaders. 
* Stage 2 crawled back to 8 & 9 on GC 
* stage 3 flat hilly FA had a terrible ride but hung onto the peloton to stay with Jax in 8/9 
* stage 4 mtn finish AJ and FA came in 8&9 to claim 7&8 overall

### Southern Alps Tour (Mixed) 6 Stages 1TT-1C-1H-3M
FA** AJ EF* AM

The Time Trial is Farina's time to shine. He'll ride in the peloton until then and afterwards be a helper. Mazza gets the same deal while Jax is lead on the cobbles then going with Albrecht for the big climbs.

Such an incredibly bad idea to do this tour.

* Stage 1 [[Mountain]] (flat finish) spent the entirety in the peloton. FA and AJ got 12 & 13 not entirely exhausted Billy King is AJ's nemesis
* Stage 2 [[Mountain]] (M finish) ugh. held onto GC status but that was ugly
* Stage 3 [[Cobble]] ([[HillyMountain]]) FA resting this stage, AM the helper for AJ who is gassed AJ crept up to 11th on GC
* Stage 4 [[TT]] AJ lost time to drop to 12 on GC
* Stage 6 [[HillyMountain]] AJ and AM are out of energy completely AJ will be falling from 12, which probably isn't so bad if they can get FA up into the top10. FA got 9th on the stage, and AJ got 12th, getting them into 9 and 10 overall
* Stage 5 [[Mountain]] ADS and HAD battling for 1 on GC (.02 between them) Need to stay ahead of Jonathan Harris and Vadim Filippov. FA 11 and AJ 14 on stage
* Overall: FA9 AJ11 EF 25 AM34

### Chrono Ridge (Mixed) MTT
AJ EF** AM* SB

Mazza is pissed that this is one of his big moments in the season. If he's coming back next season the team needs to treat him much differently.

Weird tiny race 22 node length. EF got 10th place.

### Naubad Classic (Amateur) H
FA AJ* SB*? YB*

FA came in second last year and is hoping to improve on that.

FA came in 8, but AJ got his first ever win! From a bunch sprint out of a group of 7 that escaped right at the beginning That pulled the season out of the midden heap and made for a great success heading into the Lannen Grand Prix.

### Lannen Grand Prix (Amateur) 4 Stage 1TT-1C-1H-3M 
FA AJ** EF YB**
* Stage 1 2 Climbing Jersey incl finish[[Hilly]]
* Stage 2 Red at finish [[FlatHilly]]
* Stage 3 3 red incl Mtn finish [[Mountain]]
* Stage 4 2 Red incl finish [[HillyMountain]]
