Argyll Park is the site of the Edmonton outdoor velodrome. It hosts [Wednesday Night CX](2308311008-wednesday-night-worlds.md) on alternating weeks in 2023.

When I raced the [Jim Horner Grand Prix](../220917-jimhornergrandprix2022.md) at Argyll in 2022 there was a kind of loose dirt descent that to me seemed hella steep, so I ended up dismounting and running down in my race (losing loads of time). In 2023 I heard from another CX racer that someone actually broke their collarbone on that descent, so I feel a little justified in my "safety first" approach.
