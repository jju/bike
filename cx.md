Once I was chatting with a cyclocross race organizer and he asked "Was this your first race?" I could tell he wanted it to be. He wanted to have introduced someone to the sport he loved. But it wasn't. I'd been introduced and become enamoured already. 

Now though, I'd like to be that organizer in trying to explain cyclocross to you, because it's fun and I'd like to introduce you to a sport I love.
