Once I was chatting with a cyclocross race organizer and he asked "Was this your first race?" I could tell he wanted it to be. He wanted to have introduced someone to the sport he loved. But it wasn't. I'd been introduced and become enamoured already. 

Now though, I'd like to be that organizer in trying to explain cyclocross[^1] to you, because it's fun and I'd like to introduce you to a sport I love.

[^1]: also, cyclo-cross, 'cross, or CX

# how it works

CX races are (mostly) offroad bike races that happen as a series of laps on a closed course. Each lap is about 1.5-3km long and races usually last about an hour. Everyone starts together, and the best place to be is out the front, so the best riders often get called up to the front few rows based on their previous race results.

A cyclocross course has some characteristic features:

* Pavement
* Mud
* Roots
* Climbs
* Stairs
* Off-camber
* Hurdles/Obstacles
* Sand
* Snow

The bikes that racers ride are usually drop-bar[^2] bikes with wider (sometimes knobby) tires, though beginners can ride mountain bikes. It used to be that CX bikes used cantilever brakes to fit around their wider (-than-a-road-bike's) tires but nowadays, they're mostly disc brakes.

[^2]: Drop bars are the curvy bars that allow riders to get their body positions lower. They're narrower than flat bars (usually found on mountain bikes).
