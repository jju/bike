This race took place at the Argyll Velodrome. Not in the velodrome itself, but the park surrounding it.

On the course preride it was very confusing what was going on with thetape in the back and forths. It was better in the race itself.

Clipped my pedal and wiped out on an off-camber bit, which remained my nemesis at [[221015-zombiebabywaltercross2022]].
