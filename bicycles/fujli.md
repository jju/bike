My beloved singlespeed urban track bike was purchased in Vancouver and I rode it around the city. Up the fucking hills to UBC. It was light, so light. It had one brake that didn't work too well. It was the first bike I actually did upgrades to, getting bullhorn bars with pursuit brake levers. I fucked up my left big toe on this bike in the toe-clips, and eventually sold it when I bought [[wuming|a road bike]].
