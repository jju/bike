# bullwinkle

> bought in 2015 at Cycle Therapy in Duncan $1100

Bullwinkle is my cyclocross bike. It began as more of a commuter bike back in Nanaimo, taking advantage of the wider tires than a road bike (and more gears than my pre-existing track bike [fujli](fujli.md)). 

After moving to Edmonton and getting [korg](korg.md) I moved the rack and Brooks saddle over to the heavier touring bike and Bullwinkle got to be my "fast" bike. 

Then after getting rid of [fujli](fujli.md) and getting [wuming](wuming.md) as a real go fast(ish) road bike, Bullwinkle really was allowed to go back to its roots in [CX](cx.md). I got skinny knobby tires for the dirt, and then my first real wheels I built were a pair of tubeless hoops, so the old stock wheels have become pit/bad weather wheels. Of course, the cyclocross season is only a couple of months so it's also the spring bike and the gravel bike and those old wheels still get more use.
