I'm not a fast rider, but I've entered a few bike races. Enough that my kid doesn't think it's weird. I'll be putting together some notes on my 2023 [CX](cx.md) racing below[^1].

## CX 2023

* ['Cross is Coming](2308221208-cross-is-coming.md)
* [Preparing a Season](2308291108-prepping-a-season.md)
* [Wednesday Night Worlds](2308311008-wednesday-night-worlds.md)
* [Embrace the Suck](2309191009-embrace-the-suck.md)
* Scars and Injuries

[^1]: I've made peace with the fact that cyclocross is the kind of bike racing I like to do, and am not really a road racer, or especially a criterium racer. It's possible I'll do some gravel events eventually, but CX is the sport I'd have a "season" in.

Here's a bit of writing about [my 2022 cyclocross season](2211121613-cyclocross-season.md).
