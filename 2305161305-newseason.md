I spent the winter actually using the gym we have at work, doing time on the stationary bike so as not to lose all my kilometres in my legs. They say you should do strength training and I tried but it's a pain.

The other thing I did was join a club. [Velocity Cycling Club](https:velocitycyclingclub.ca) is my new bunch. I went on my first group ride and it was fun, about 60km and easy riding. I self-selected to the slow group, and was the only person in it (along with the bunch leader). But it was good. I got to learn about some of the group riding norms and hand signals. Old Paul was very welcoming in general and did a good job showing me how to get close to people in the bunch.

And now I signed up for [[230527-stiedaclassic2023|another race]]. This time I'm part of a club so maybe it won't be so lonely out there. I can look for the red jerseys of my people and get some tips. I'm in the Citizen category which is the bunch of people who can't get upgrade points but I think that'll be more my speed than trying to race against competitive people.
