I rode cyclocross races this season but they don't feel like cyclocross. They aren't muddy and cold. Part of that was due to the boiling frog that we are as a planet but part of that is due to living in Edmonton, where we don't really get shoulder seasons. The abrupt floompf of winter that happened on November 2 starts fatbike season, not a time for racing in mud, like in Europe (or even Victoria, which is where I note )
